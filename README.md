# README

Electro is a light static site generator similar to `mkdocs` but with improved menu navigation at the expense of dropping support for older browsers.

There isn't any documentation and there aren't any examples yet, since it's still a work in progress.

I am using it "in production" for a few real projects, so it's working, and fairly stable.

## v1.0.2 Milestone
`v1.0.2` is arguably the first "production ready" release; it merges the ability to generate static sites with the ability to generate "single file" documents (i.e. a published document as a single `.html` file with embedded images, etc. suitable for emailing, archiving, etc.)

The project is still missing proper documentation or examples. Example documents to follow next.
