# README

Electro is a light static site generator similar to mkdocs but with improved menu navigation at 
the expense of dropping support for older browsers.

There isn't any documentation and there aren't any examples yet, since it's still a work in progress.

I am using it "in production" for a few real projects, so it's working, but the API/config syntax 
may change before 1.0.0
